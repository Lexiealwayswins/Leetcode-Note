# 142. Linked List Cycle II - Medium

## Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.
 

### Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1  
**Output:** tail connects to node index 1  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.  

### Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0  
**Output:** tail connects to node index 0  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.  

### Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1  
**Output:** no cycle  
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.  
 

### Constraints:

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
- -105 <= Node.val <= 105
- pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
 

### Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

## Solution Notes:

- Two pointer approach
- The fast pointer moves two steps one time, the slow pointer moves one step one time
- If fast and slow pointer meets, then there is a ring
- (x + y) * 2 = x + y + n (y + z)
- x + y = n (y + z)
- x = n (y + z) - y
- x = (n - 1) (y + z) + z
- if n = 1, then x = z
- if n > 1, the situation is the same
- A pointer starts from the head node, and a pointer also starts from the meeting node. These two pointers only go one node at a time. So when these two pointers meet, it is the node of the ring entrance.


## Codes:

```Java

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            while(fast == slow) {
                ListNode index1 = head;
                ListNode index2 = fast;
                while(index1 != index2) {
                    index1 = index1.next;
                    index2 = index2.next;
                }
                return index1;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
